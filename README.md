<h1>JsSound</h1>
<p>
JsSound makes it very simple to attach sound events to elements. JsSound can be used on either class or id selectors, can take either a file name as a string or to accomodate different browsers can accept an array of different files.
</p>
<p>
JsSound will detect the capabilities of the browser and as long as the correct format is supplied will use that format.
